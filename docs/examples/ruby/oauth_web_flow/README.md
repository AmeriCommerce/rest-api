Ruby Web Flow Example
=====================

Makes use of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Rack](http://rack.github.io/).

You will need to update the file `config.yml` with settings applicable to your app and AmeriCommerce store.

To run the example, use rack to run the file `config.ru`:

```shell
rackup config.ru
```
