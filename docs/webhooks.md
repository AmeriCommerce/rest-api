Webhooks
========

Webhooks are a way to run code on an external server that integrates with events in the AmeriCommerce. When the conditions are fulfilled, the AmeriCommerce will make a request out to a URL, and, depending on the webhook, wait for a response.

In the case of events that expect responses, the timeout is intentionally short (3 seconds), since any delay can potentially be disrupting to users of the store. It is highly recommended that your service return results as quickly as possible.

### Webhook Types

| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| AuthorizingPayment | Called to authorize a payment | Yes |
| CapturingPayment | Called to capture a payment | Yes |

| ValidateCheckout | Called when the checkout page is being checked for errors | Yes |
| GetDiscount | Called when calculating discounts for a cart | Yes |

### Subscribing to a Webhook

Webhook subscriptions are accessible via `/api/v1/webhooks`, which works exactly the same as any other API endpoint. The webhook resource consists of the following fields:

 * `event_type` - The webhook type, as shown in the table above.
 * `url` - The URL that will be sent a request when the conditions for the event are met.
 * `failure_type` - What to do in the event of a failure, options are:
   * `"Ignore"` - Disregard the failure and continue as normal, this is the default.
   * `"Error"` - Display an error message to the user.
   * `"Fallback"` - Call an alternate URL as indicated by the `fallback_url` field.
 * `store_id` - The ID of the store, as shown on the [`store`](resources/stores.md) resource, that this webhook applies to. Only events on this store will be triggered. 
 * `cache_length` - How long the response to this webhook request will be cached by the AmeriCommerce servers, options are:
   * `"Short"` - 5 minutes
   * `"Long"` - 30 minutes
   * `"NoCache"` - Do not cache the response.
 * `fallback_url` - In the event of a failure, and the `failure_type` is set to `"Fallback"`, this URL will be called next.


For this example, the token needs to have "View and change order data" and "Perform system tasks" [`scope`](scopes.md).

```shell
curl -X POST  \
  -H "X-AC-Auth-Token: [TOKEN]"  \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  \
  -H "Cache-Control: no-cache"  \
  -d '{ \
	"event_type": "OrderPlace", \
	"url": "https://[webhookhost.com]/OrderPlacedProcessor", \
	"failure_type": "Fallback", \
	"store_id": 1, \
	"cache_length": "Short", \
	"fallback_url": "https://[webhookhost.com]/fallback/OrderPlacedProcessor" \
   }'  \
   "https://[mystoredomain.com]/api/v1/webhooks" 
```
